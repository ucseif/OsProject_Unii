# Scheduling Algorithms Project

This project implements various CPU scheduling algorithms, including FCFS (First-Come, First-Served), HPF (Highest Priority First), Round Robin, and SRTF (Shortest Remaining Time First). The project also includes a process generator and a script to visualize the results.

## Project Structure

- **fcfs.py**: Implements the FCFS scheduling algorithm.
- **hpf.py**: Implements the HPF scheduling algorithm.
- **round_robin.py**: Implements the Round Robin scheduling algorithm.
- **srtf.py**: Implements the SRTF scheduling algorithm.
- **process_generator.py**: Generates random processes based on specified distributions.
- **generate_graphs.py**: Generates graphs comparing the average waiting time and turnaround time for each algorithm.
- **metrics.txt**: Stores the metrics for each algorithm run.
- **output.txt**: Contains the generated processes.
- **input.txt**: Contains parameters for the process generator.
